Title: Work Instruction to Mitigate Slow Database Queries

**Symptom:** The application is slow, and monitoring shows high database CPU usage. The API is reporting P99 latency over 3000ms.

**Triage Steps:**
1.  Connect to the production database monitoring dashboard.
2.  Identify the top 5 queries by CPU and execution time.
3.  Look for queries performing full table scans on large tables like 'users' or 'event_logs'.

**Mitigation Procedure:**
1.  For the identified slow query, run an `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to confirm the query plan.
2.  If a full table scan is confirmed, a missing index is the likely cause.
3.  **IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Add a new index to the relevant columns. For example, if queries on the 'users' table are slow on the 'email' column, execute: `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_on_email ON users (email);`
4.  Monitor database CPU. It should return to normal levels within 5 minutes.
