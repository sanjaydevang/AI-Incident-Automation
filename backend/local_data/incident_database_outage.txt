Title: Database Outage on EU-West-1

On June 15, 2024, our primary PostgreSQL database cluster experienced a total outage.
The root cause was identified as disk space exhaustion on the primary node.
The monitoring alert for low disk space failed to trigger.
Resolution involved manually expanding the disk volume and restarting the database service.
Preventative measures include fixing the monitoring alert and implementing automated disk space scaling.
